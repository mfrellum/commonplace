> A **Commonplace book** is a scrapbook used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts they have learned. They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the Renaissance and in the nineteenth century. Such books are similar to scrapbooks filled with items of many kinds: sententiae (often with the compiler's responses), notes, proverbs, adages, aphorisms, maxims, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, prayers, legal formulas, and recipes.[^3]

With the advent of ChatGTP and it's likes we need an honest and feedback frindly document format.

The goal is to make documents with the help of AI that is well put together and curated by the human cowriter. Edits of AI generated contents are traceable and can be used in feedback loops to improve AI models/knowledge graphs. It will also be a way of showing the value added by the cowriter instead of only branding AI assisted work as unoriginal and cheating.
